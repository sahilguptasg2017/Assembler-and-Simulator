## Input

Put the assembly code in `stdin.txt` and then run `assembler.py`. Make sure your current working directory is the root of the git repository.

Output will be in a file `stdout.txt`.

# IMPORTANT: UNIX and DOS file differences

The testcases in the given ZIP files in Google Classroom are in DOS format, and the output files in this repo are in UNIX format. This causes the output to have diffs with the testcases in the ZIP file because of the CRLF in DOS files, and LF in the UNIX files, even though both of them are otherwise the same.

**In Conclusion, Please convert the DOS test files to UNIX format before testing, which can be done with the following terminal command: **

```
tr -d '\015' < original_dos_file_path > unix_file_path
```
